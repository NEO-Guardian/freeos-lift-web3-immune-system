# Security Policy

## Status

This repository is a **reference implementation** of the N.E.O. Web3 Immune System
for Freeos / Lift style projects on ICP / DFINITY.

Treat it as a **pattern and starting point**, not a finished, audited module.

Before putting real funds behind any implementation based on this repo, projects should:

- Commission an independent security review / audit
- Run extensive simulation, fuzzing and chaos testing
- Start with limited value and monitor behaviour closely

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue in a live deployment that uses this pattern,
please follow that project’s **responsible disclosure** process.

For this reference repo itself, you can:

- Open a GitHub issue marked `security` with a **high-level** description, or  
- Contact the maintainer privately if sensitive details are involved  

Please do **not** include private keys, user PII, or other sensitive data in public issues.
