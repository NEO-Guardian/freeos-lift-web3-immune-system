# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving the **N.E.O. Web3 Immune System – Freeos/Lift ICP Edition**.

This repository is a **reference pattern**. The goal is to help projects wrap
their protocols with a Guardian layer that improves safety without hiding risk.

## Ways you can contribute

- Add concrete implementations (Motoko / Rust / other) based on the guardian pattern  
- Improve documentation and diagrams  
- Propose additional policy modules (governance guardian, oracle health checks, etc.)  
- Share integration notes for other chains and deployments  

## General guidelines

1. Keep security in mind first.  
2. Keep changes small and focused where possible.  
3. Explain the reasoning behind any new policy or control you add.  
4. Avoid including any secrets, private keys or user data in tests or examples.
